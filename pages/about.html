    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>My name is Markus, and I was born in Richmond, BC. I graduated from UBC 
       last year with a BA in English Literature. I enrolled in this program at
       BCIT because I believe this field will continue to be <strong>extremely 
       important</strong> as well as relevent to my own interests. Previously, 
       I have tutored high school and elementary students in math and English 
       for quite a few years, but I decided not to pursue a career in education 
       on account of my discovery that I <em>don't actually like kids.</em>
