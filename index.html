    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>My name is Markus, and I was born in Richmond, BC.  I graduated from <br>
       UBC last year with a BA in English Literature.  I enrolled in this <br>
       program at BCIT because I believe this field will continue to be <br>
       <strong>extremely important</strong> as well as relevent to my own interests.<br>
       Previously, I have tutored high school and elementary students in <br>
       math and English for quite a few years, but I decided not to pursue <br>
       a career in education on account of the fact that I've found out I
       <em> hate kids.</em>
    </p>
